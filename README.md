If you're looking to use Cookiecutter with your C# Azure Services DocumentDB project, here are some steps you can follow to create a template based on your existing repository and use it to generate new projects:

**Step 1: Create a Cookiecutter Template**
To turn your existing project into a Cookiecutter template, you'll need to set up a template structure and create a cookiecutter.json file.

**1.1. Set Up Template Structure**
**1. Clone Your Repository:**

Clone your repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/vivalams/csharp-azure-services-documentdb.git
cd csharp-azure-services-documentdb

**2. Modify File Names and Content:**

Replace specific details in file names and contents with Cookiecutter placeholders using {{ cookiecutter.variable_name }} syntax. For example, if your project has a specific name, replace it with a placeholder:

File names: Rename files like csharp-azure-services-documentdb.csproj to {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.csproj.
File content: In your Program.cs or any configuration files, replace specific strings with placeholders.
**3. Create cookiecutter.json:**

In the root of your project directory, create a cookiecutter.json file with the variables you want to prompt users for. Example:

{
    "project_name": "CSharp Azure Services DocumentDB",
    "project_slug": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '_') }}",
    "author_name": "Vijay Kumar ",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "A C# project for Azure DocumentDB services."
}
**1.2. Structure Your Repository**
Ensure your template is organized, with placeholders in the correct locations. Here’s a simplified structure:

csharp-azure-services-documentdb/
├── {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
│   ├── Program.cs
│   ├── {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.csproj
│   └── ...
├── cookiecutter.json
└── README.md

**Step 2: Use the Template with Cookiecutter**
Once your template is set up, you can use Cookiecutter to generate new projects:

**1. Run Cookiecutter:**

Use Cookiecutter to generate a new project from your template:

cookiecutter path/to/csharp-azure-services-documentdb

Replace path/to/csharp-azure-services-documentdb with the actual path to your template directory.

**2. Fill in the Prompts:**

Cookiecutter will prompt you with questions based on the variables defined in cookiecutter.json. Provide the necessary information.

**3. Review and Customize:**

Once the project is generated, review the files and customize them as needed for your new project.

**Step 3: Share Your Template**
You can host your Cookiecutter template on GitHub or another version control platform, allowing others to easily use it:

**1. Initialize a New Repository:**

If it's not already a separate repository, create a new one for your template.

**2. Push Your Template:**

Push your template files to the repository.

**3. Share the Repository URL:**

Others can use your template by running the Cookiecutter command with your repository URL:

cookiecutter https://github.com/vivalams/csharp-azure-services-documentdb-template
